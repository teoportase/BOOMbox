# List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
stages:
  - build

### Define variables
variables:
  OBJECTS_DIRECTORY: 'obj'
  NUGET_PACKAGES_DIRECTORY: '.nuget'
  SOURCE_CODE_PATH: 'BoomBoxWeb/BoomBoxWeb/'

### Define global cache
cache:
  key: "CI_JOB_STAGE-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG"
  paths:
    # Specify three paths that should be cached
    # 1) Main JSON file holding information about package dependency tree, packages versions,
    # frameworks etc. It also holds information where to the dependencies were restored.
    - '$SOURCE_CODE_PATH$OBJECTS_DIRECTORY/project.assets.json'
    # 2) Other NuGet and MSBuild related files. Also needed.
    - '$SOURCE_CODE_PATH$OBJECTS_DIRECTORY/*.csproj.nuget.*'
    # 3) Path to the directory where restored dependencies are kept.
    - '$NUGET_PACKAGES_DIRECTORY'

  # 'pull-push' policy means that latest cache will be downloaded (if it exists)
  # before executing the job, and a newer version will be uploaded afterwards.
  policy: pull-push

### Restore project dependencies
before_script:
  # Change to the correct directory
  - 'cd "BoomBoxWeb/BoomBoxWeb/"'
  - 'dotnet restore --packages $NUGET_PACKAGES_DIRECTORY'
